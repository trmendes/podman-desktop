Imagine a world where you can effortlessly run Wasm binaries and distribute them using Open Container Initiative (OCI) container images \u2013 a singular image deployable across multiple architectures.\\n\\nThough the concept seemed straightforward, accomplishing this task proved to be quite challenging, particularly on macOS and Windows. The complexity comes from the additional virtual machine running Linux. This machine needs all of the dependencies and prerequisites correctly setup.\\n\\nThe wait is over. Our blog post unveils the solution, guiding you through the process of enabling Wasm workloads on both macOS and Windows.\\n\\n![hero](img/run-webassembly-wasm-workloads-windows-and-macos/webassembly-podman.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is WebAssembly ?\\n\\n[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (abbreviated\xa0Wasm) was designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, improving performance and portability of web applications (including gaming/emulators). Using a low-level binary format instead of JavaScript boosts applications to have near-native performance.\\n\\nThe binary format serves as a compilation target and it allows to use a wider range of programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust. While it was a browser/client technology, now it is evolving beyond the web, for example being adapted for use as a back-end or edge technology (this is for example what happened to Java that was first designed for the client side before landing to the server side).\\n\\nThe Wasm binary format was designed to be secure. Wasm modules are isolated from the rest of the system, and they cannot access any system resources without explicit permission. This makes Wasm modules very safe to run, even in untrusted environments. But on another hand, for developing backend applications, this restriction is limiting the usage of Wasm.\\n\\n## The extension of WebAssembly\\n\\nWebAssembly System Interface (WASI) was born as an essential complement to WebAssembly.\\n\\nIt is a system interface that extends WebAssembly\'s capabilities beyond the browser, making it suitable for a wider range of environments, including servers, edge devices, and more.\\n\\nWhile with Wasm you had limited access to the host resources, WASI provides a standard set of system calls, enabling WebAssembly modules to interact with the host operating system in a secure and consistent manner: it includes filesystem access, sockets, and other low-level resources.\\n\\n## Running WebAssembly outside the browser\\n\\nWasm has shipped in the major browser engines so the usage of Wasm is possible without any 3rd party addition in the browser land. But when it comes to the edge/system usage, you need to find a virtual machine to run these workloads supporting WASI extension. And there is not only one application to run them, there are several Wasm runtimes such as WasmEdge, Wasmtime, Wasmer, and so on. All runtimes support different CPU architectures.\\n\\nSince WASI is still maturing some of the API provided in these runtimes has not reached the standard, so users need to be careful to write portable applications that do not depend on a given runtime.\\n\\nBesides running Wasm/WASI workloads on your computer, there is also the question of how you package this binary format, share, and distribute it. A\xa0convenient way to distribute and run these workloads is to use OCI images as it provides all the basics: package, storage and distribution of the binaries. Then comes the execution part.\\n\\n## Using Podman engine with Wasm\\n\\nWhen using containers with Podman on macOS or Windows, you have a virtual machine called a \\"Podman machine\\" that is executing a Linux environment. We need to add support for Wasm inside this Linux environment. Podman is using the crun project as its OCI runtime, so crun needs to be able to run or delegate execution to Wasm runtimes. Lucky for us, crun supports Wasm execution.\\n\\nFrom the user\'s point of view, support for Wasm is provided as an additional platform. So when executing a Wasm workload, we specify as a platform `--platform=wasi/wasm` instead of for example `--platform=linux/arm64` or `--platform=linux/amd64`.\\n\\n\u200b\\n\\n## Running Wasm workload with podman\\n\\n### Setup\\n\\n<Tabs groupId=\\"operating-systems\\">\\n<TabItem value=\\"win\\" label=\\"Windows\\">\\n\\nOn Windows, ensure that your podman machine is a recent one. You can check using the `podman version` command.\\n\\nDepending on the output of the command, you might have extra steps to do.\\n\\n- Client\'s version and server\'s side version >= v4.7.0: Nothing to do, Wasm support is already there using the wasmedge runtime by default.\\n- Client\'s version >= 4.6.0 but server\'s side version < 4.7.

It helps to consume Wasm binaries. But another interesting case is to distribute and build these Wasm images so anyone could run them quickly.\\n\\nThe goal is to have a minimal image containing only the Wasm binary. For that we will use a multi-stage build. First stage will be the platform to build/compile the `.wasm` binary file and the second/last stage will copy the binary to a scratch image.\\n\\nWhen building images it will use by default the architecture of the host operating system. If you are using a Mac computer with ARM chip, then the Linux images will default to `linux/arm64`. Using a mac/intel it will default to `linux/amd64` images. In the case of Wasm workloads, the expected target platform is\xa0`wasi/wasm`.\\n\\nWith podman we can use the flag `--platform=wasi/wasm` on the `podman build` command to specify the system/architecture. But if we do that, it means that if the Dockerfile or Containerfile contains as base image\xa0`FROM docker.io/redhat/ubi9-minimal`\xa0for example it will try to fetch a `ubi9-minimal` image using the `wasi/wasm` platform but of course it does not exist.\\n\\nSo we need to tweak the Containerfile to include a `--platform`\xa0directive inside the Containerfile.\\n\\nExample of\xa0Containerfile:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nFROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM docker.io/redhat/ubi9-minimal as builder\\n```\\n\\nUsing this method, we will fetch an image matching our host architecture but as there is still the\xa0 `--platform=wasi/wasm`\xa0on the command line, the resulting image will use the right platform.\\n\\n### Source code\\n\\nHere is a simple Containerfile to build a rust application using\xa0wasm32-wasi binary output and a multi-layer OCI image. One layer for the build (installing rust, dependencies and compiling the application) and one scratch layer where we only add the `.wasm` output and flag it as the entrypoint.\\n\\nSource code is available at https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo/tree/main/wasm/rust-hello-world\\n\\n`Containerfile` content:\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\n# Build using the host platform (and not target platform wasi/wasm)\\nFROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM docker.io/redhat/ubi9-minimal as builder\\n\\n# install rust and Wasm/WASI target\\nRUN curl --proto \'=https\' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y \\\\\\n\xa0 \xa0 && source \\"$HOME/.cargo/env\\" && rustup target add wasm32-wasi\\n\\n# copy source code\\nCOPY Cargo.toml /app/\\nCOPY src /app/src\xa0\\n\\n# change working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Build\\nRUN source \\"$HOME/.cargo/env\\" && cd /app && cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release\\n\\n# now copy the Wasm binary and flag it as the entrypoint\\nFROM scratch\\nENTRYPOINT [ \\"/rust-hello-world.wasm\\" ]\\nCOPY --from=builder /app/target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-hello.wasm /rust-hello-world.wasm\\n\xa0\\n```\\n\\nThe `Cargo.toml` content:\\n\\n```toml\\n[package]\\nname = \\"rust-hello-world\\"\\nversion = \\"0.1.0\\"\\nedition = \\"2021\\"\\n\\n[[bin]]\\nname = \\"rust-hello\\"\\npath = \\"src/main.rs\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd the rust program `src/main.rs`:\\n\\n```toml\\n\\n  fn main() {\\n\\n\xa0 \xa0 // use of strings literal for multi-line string\\n\xa0 \xa0 // https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/tokens.html#raw-string-literals\\n\\n\xa0 \xa0 // ascii art from M\xe1ir\xedn Duffy @mairin\\n\xa0 \xa0 let hello = r#\\"\\n!...

With pose, you use a YAML file to configure your application\u2019s services, networks, and volumes. This allows you to capture in a single file the entire configuration necessary to run a set of interconnected containers as an application. For example, if you have an application that requires a web server, a database, and a caching service, you can define these components and their relationships in your Compose file.\\n\\nTo use the Compose YAML, you can use a specification implementation such as [`podman compose`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) and [`docker compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose).\\n\\n## Before we begin\\n\\nIf you do not have Compose installed, let\'s go through the onboarding process to install the Compose implementation binary:\\n\\n1. Get to Resources under **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Resources**.\\n2. Click **Setup** under Compose (it will appear if it has not been installed yet).\\n3. Go through the onboarding process.\\n\\n![Onboarding process](img/getting-started-with-compose/onboarding.png)\\n\\nConfirm that you are able to run `podman compose`:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman compose\\nRun compose workloads via an external provider such as docker-compose or podman-compose\\n\\nDescription:\\n  This command is a thin wrapper around an external compose provider such as docker-compose or podman-compose.  This means that podman compose is executing another tool that implements the compose functionality but sets up the environment in a way to let the compose provider communicate transparently with the local Podman socket.  The specified options as well the command and argument are passed directly to the compose provider.\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Download and run the example application\\n\\nOur example application is located at [github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo).\\n\\nWe will use `git clone` so we can build the Go binary web application:\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-demo\\ncd podman-desktop-demo/guestbook-compose\\n```\\n\\nRun `podman compose up -d` to start the application:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman compose up -d\\n>>>> Executing external compose provider \\"/usr/local/bin/docker-compose\\".

This allows for readability even if the Redis leader is unavailable.\\n- `/env`: View the container\'s environment variables.\\n- `/info`: View information about the Redis cluster.\\n\\n![Guestbook application](img/getting-started-with-compose/helloworld.png)\\n\\n## Viewing and modifying the database\\n\\nUsing Podman Desktop, you can also access the container\'s terminal directly from the GUI and modify the database.\\n\\nClick \\"Open Terminal\\" to access the `redis-leader` terminal:\\n\\n![Open terminal](img/getting-started-with-compose/openterminal.png)\\n\\nModify the database as if you are doing database administration:\\n\\n1. Run `redis-cli` within the container to access the Redis database.\\n2. Type `LPUSH guestbook \\"Hello World!\\"` and you will see your web application update in real-time.\\n3. Type `DEL guestbook` and you will see that your database drops the `guestbook` key and clears the database.\\n\\n![Redis CLI](img/getting-started-with-compose/redis-cli.png)\\n\\nChanges will reflect in real-time on the guestbook.\\n\\nYou can further modify the database and see the changes propagate to the Redis replicas.\\n\\nFor example, view the logs of the `redis-replica`, and you will notice that there are periodic database synchronizations as well as reads to the database:\\n\\n![Redis replica logs](img/getting-started-with-compose/redisreplica.png)\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nA quick overview of how the architecture works in this multi-container scenario:\\n\\n- Within the Guestbook application, it looks for a database with the names `redis-leader` and `redis-replica` on port 6379.\\n- Because it is a Compose application, the containers are connected on the same network. This means that a neighboring container can be network-accessible simply by its container name.\\n\\nThere is a set of environment variables that the web application can modify in the Compose application:\\n\\n- `REDIS_LEADER`: The default is `redis-leader`.\\n- `REDIS_REPLICAS`: The default is `redis-replica`. Can be comma-separated, such as `redis-replica-1,redis-replica-2`.\\n- `REDIS_PORT`: The default is `6379`.\\n- `SERVER_PORT`: The default is `8080`.\\n\\n## Scaling more replicas\\n\\nWant to scale more replicas? This can be achieved by adding an environment variable to your `compose.yaml` and duplicating your `redis-replica` entry.\\n\\nModify your `compose.yaml` as follows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nservices:\\n  redis-leader:\\n    container_name: redis-leader\\n    image: redis:latest\\n    ports:\\n      - \'6379\'\\n\\n  redis-replica:\\n    container_name: redis-replica\\n    image: redis:latest\\n    ports:\\n      - \'6379\'\\n    command: redis-server --replicaof redis-leader 6379\\n\\n  redis-replica-2:\\n    container_name: redis-replica-2\\n    image: redis:latest\\n    ports:\\n      - \'6379\'\\n    command: redis-server --replicaof redis-leader 6379\\n\\n  web:\\n    container_name: web\\n    build: ./web\\n    environment:\\n      - REDIS_REPLICAS=redis-replica1,redis-replica2\\n    ports:\\n      - \'8080:8080\'\\n```\\n\\nRun `podman compose up -d` again to ensure the new container has been added and the new environment variable has propagated:\\n\\n```sh\\npodman compose up -d\\n>>>> Executing external compose provider \\"/usr/local/bin/docker-compose\\".

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### Minikube featured extension\\n\\nFor developers who need to run Kubernetes locally and reproduce an environment close to production for development and experimentation purposes, Podman Desktop allows users to easily set up that environment on a local machine. There are two extensions providing the capability to configure a open source Kubernetes cluster locally, you can either choose between [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).\\n\\nThe Minikube extension allows you to install Minikube on your workstation and also to setup a Kubernetes cluster locally running in a container! Yes, you read that correctly - in a container similar to how Kind works. The advantage is that it\'s lighter and faster to start. With Minikube, one of the advantage, is that you can build your images locally with Podman and get them automatically available in your local Kubernetes cluster - which will speed up your turnarounds when you want to test your application. If you want to learn more this, read the [following blog post](https://podman-desktop.io/blog/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster).\\n\\n![Minikube-feature-extension](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/minikube-feature-extension.png)\\n\\n### Command-Line Tools Configuration: Compose and Kubectl\\n\\nConfiguring and managing your setup is getting easier with the addition of a new section in the Settings to manage command-line tools. In Podman Desktop, extensions can list command-line tools that are helpful to their users or required to make use of the installed extensions.\\n\\nThere are two command-line tools within Podman Desktop that allows you to view whether they are installed or require an update:\\n\\n- Compose binary for running \'podman compose\' commands.\\n- kubectl for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n![cli-tools](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/cli-tools.png)\\n\\nFrom the settings you can see the command-line tools that are installed, and you can see the version - and when a new version is available, you\'ll get a small notification to allow you easily update to that version.\\n\\n![Compose-Update](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/compose-update.png)\\n\\n### Kubernetes Contexts Manager\\n\\nWe are introducing a new screen available from the Settings which allows you to easily manage your Kubernetes contexts. Podman Desktop was already providing the handy context switcher available from the status bar, but when you get to work with multiple Kubernetes environments, it\'s not uncommon to end with a big and long list of Kubernetes contexts.\\n\\nThe new Kubernetes Contexts screen allows you to easily see all your registered Kubernetes contexts. You can use the screen to clean up your registered contexts, or set the current (default) context.\\n\\n![Kubernetes Contexts List](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/kubernetes-contexts.png)\\n\\n### Editable Podman Machine\\n\\nA Podman machine is a virtual environment specifically designed to run Podman containers on Mac and Windows. It allows users to manage and operate containerized applications in an isolated and controlled setting. When creating a Podman machine, you configure its settings: memory, CPU(s) and disk size.\\n\\nWe\'ve received the feedback regarding the ability to reconfigure your Podman machine on the go. This is now possible for macOS users, and particularly useful when you start with an environment and need to scale it up based on new needs and containers you would like to run in your Podman environment.\\n\\n![Editable podman machine](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/91150767-58a9-47b5-abbc-58d2d50f4fca)\\n\\nYou\'ll notice we improved the sliders to configure the Podman machine\'s options - and also introduced a way to enter numeric values directly.\\n\\n### Tabs/Filters for Containers and Pods\\n\\nBeing able to quickly identify the containers and the pods you are working with is critical when you are iterating on the development of your application. For this reason, we added filters at the top of the lists of Containers and Pods that allow you to easily view all the containers/pods, only those that are running, or only those that are stopped.\\n\\n![Filters for containers and pods](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/37190c74-7fa5-485e-81a4-bd970f606286)\\n\\n### Sorting for Volumes and Images lists\\n\\nThe lists of Volumes and Images have improved and are now have the ability to be sorted by the criteria of your choice. You can for example filter images by their size - which can be convenient when you want to clean up your environment.\\n\\n![Sorting for Volumes and Images](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/0d20b5c2-517c-4ccc-8992-b8df275bcc30)\\n\\n### Environment columns on Containers and Pods lists\\n\\nPodman Desktop is able to work with multiple providers: it could work with multiple container engines and multiple Kubernetes environments too. In order to make it easier to identify the containers and the pods and differentiate them depending on which environment they are running onto, we are introducing a new environment column in the list of Containers and Pods to display a badge.\\n\\n![Environment Column](img/podman-desktop-release-1.6/environment-column.png)\\n\\n#### Better visibility to the containers running in Pods\\n\\nThe list of Pods has been refined to provide easier visibility and access to the containers running within each of them. Each of the containers now have one dot and you can hover each dot to display the info about the container - and if you click on it you\'ll be able to access the details of the container.\\n\\n![Visibility for containers in Pods](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/assets/1636769/0e88a88e-9a17-4261-b60f-b4d09ca19127)\\n\\n### Extension API improvements\\n\\nThe \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop extension API received many improvements, including:\\n\\n- Documentation explaining how to create an onboarding workflow for an extension [#4837](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4837)\\n- Documented how extensions hook into UI [#4633](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4633)\\n- Documented how to

One of the challenges we face is quickly iterating when working with container images and kubernetes deployments/pods.\\n\\nFor example, when we want to try a new image in a kubernetes pod, this image needs to be available on a private/public registry or on the nodes of the kubernetes cluster.\\nSometimes we need to call extra commands such as `kind load docker-image` or `minikube cache add <image>` or publish the image first to a 3rd party registry.\\n\\nYou\'ll agree that trying out a new image in a Kubernetes pod should be as seamless as building the image itself.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we will explore the best practice for streamlining the image iteration process in Kubernetes with Podman Desktop.\\n\\n![hero](img/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster/selkie-family.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nWhen using kind or minikube or other 3rd party tools to setup a local kubernetes cluster, we have several ways to publish images.\\n\\nMinikube published 8 ways of doing that at https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/\\n\\nThere are pros and cons either way. Using a third party registry implies that you need to publish the image after each build of the image before being able to use it in the kubernetes cluster. While Podman Desktop could automate the synchronization between the local registry (where you are doing `podman build`) and the third party registry, there remains a duplication of layers between the local and third party registry. And if you change the first layer, it can take a lot of time to send again all the data.\\n\\nLoading images requires to pack/unpack the files so it\'s not adequate for large images.\\n\\nMinikube offers a Podman environment, but it\'s important to note that it utilizes version 3.4 inside a container within the Podman machine. This implies the existence of two Podman instances.\\n\\nThe 3.4 version is considerably outdated and do not provide new enhancements and support towards compose, compliance with Docker REST API and 3rd party tools.\\n\\nCould we just build the image and use it in kubernetes?\\n\\n## podman and kubernetes/cri-o\\n\\nIn the kubernetes world, we need a container engine runtime. At the early stage, container runtimes were integrated with ad hoc solutions on top of docker, rkt, or others.\\n\\nBut to separate concerns and to be extensible, a new interface was added: CRI for \\"Container Runtime Interface\\". Using the CRI interface we can plug container engines. And there are several runtimes such as containerd, cri-o and others.\\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md\\n\\nWhat is interesting to us is the cri-o project. This project is implementing the CRI interface but also adopting some projects of the [containers](https://github.com/containers) organization where [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman) and [podman-desktop](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop) live.\\n\\nSo it means cri-o uses image management from https://github.com/containers/image project and handle storage with https://github.com/containers/storage project.\\n\\nAnd this is what is really interesting as a podman user. As it is using common libraries between cri-o and podman, it means that in the same environment, podman and cri-o read and write the images at a common location in `/var/lib/containers` folder.\\n\\nIf we move one step ahead, if we mount the `/var/lib/containers` folder of podman into the cri-o container it means that the kubernetes cluster could find the images that the podman machine is building.\\n\\nOh wait, it means that no more registry, additional steps would be required? Yes just build and load it.\\n\\n## Minikube to the rescue\\n\\nWhile we have the goal of using both cri-o and podman altogether, we can explore the current projects allowing us to quickly setup kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n### kind\\n\\nOn the `kind` side, there is a default configuration that is using containerd and there is no plan to support an alternative such as cri-o https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1369#issuecomment-867440704\\n\\nThat said, some people try to maintain a way to do that but not officialy https://gist.github.com/aojea/bd1fb766302779b77b8f68fa0a81c0f2\\n\\nBy doing that, we would also need to mount `/var/lib/containers` folder from the host (the podman machine) to the container. And there is no easy flag in kind.\\n\\n### Minikube\\n\\n#### Minikube options\\n\\nMinikube supports more options and provides a way to select the container engine runtime. And it includes support for cri-o.\\n\\nWe can use the `container-runtime` parameter and ask for `cri-o` runtime. Command-line should include `--container-runtime=cri-o`.\\n\\nThen, we do have a podman/cri-o environment inside the container and can use `eval $(minikube podman-env)` to use the Windows/macOS podman CLI.\\n\\nOne issue is that we then have two \'Podman engines\': one running inside the Podman machine and another one running inside the container. The Podman included in the container is using version 3.4, as it\'s on Debian/Ubuntu stable, while the recent version of Podman is 4.7.x.\\n\\nCan we mount the podman machine `/var/lib/containers` into the container ?\\n\\nYes! minikube provides some options to do additional mount with `--mount-string` argument. It is not obvious but you also need to add the `--mount` in addition to this parameter. Full argument is `--mount --mount-string \\"<host-path:container-path>\\"`\\n\\nBut `/var` is already a mounted folder. So here the idea is to change the path of where cri-o is storing its data.\\n\\nSo we can provide a custom mounted path and make cri-o use that custom location. Let\'s pickup `/host-containers`.\\n\\nWhen starting minikube we need then to add `--mount --mount-string \\"/var/lib/containers:/host-containers\\"`.\\n\\nRegarding the configuration of cri-o, currently, it\'s not achievable using Minikube options. However, Minikube does offer the flexibility to modify the base image.\\n\\n#### Minikube kicbase image\\n\\nLet\'s do our own base image named kicbase image.\\n\\nMinikube includes a default configuration file for cri-o.\\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.32.0/deploy/kicbase/02-crio.conf\\n\\nWe need to change this default configuration to say that for storing the images, cri-o needs to use another directory. This new directory `/host-containers` will be mounted from the `/var/lib/containers` folder inside the podman machine. This is how cri-o is able to see podman images.\\n\\nLet\'s include the configuration part in this file.\\n\\n```toml\\n[crio]\\nroot = \\"/host-containers/storage\\"\\nrunroot = \\"/host-containers/storage\\"\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s also upgrade the Podman inside the container by adding the necessary instruction to the Dockerfile.\\n\\nThe Dockerfile is coming from https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.32.0/deploy/kicbase/Dockerfile#L178-L186\\n\\nIn the file, replace\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nRUN clean-install podman && \\\\\\n```\\n\\nwith\\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nRUN sh -c \\"echo \'deb https://downloadcontent.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/unstable/xUbuntu_22.04/ /\' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable.list\\" && \\\\\\n    curl -LO https://downloadcontent.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:unstable/xUbuntu_22.04/Release.key && \\\\\\n    apt-key add - < Release.key && \\\\\\n    # need to add dbus-user-session else we have\\n    # cannot open sd-bus: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found\\n    clean-install dbus-user-session podman && \\\\\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s rebuild the image and publish it. You can find it at `quay.io/fbenoit/kicbase:multiarch-2023-11-06` .\\nTo build the image, clone https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube repository, and edit the files referenced before.\\n\\nThe command to build the kicbase image is `make local-kicbase`.\\n\\n#### Trying out cri-o using the podman machine storage folder\\n\\nAt the time of writing this blog post, the version `v1.32.0-beta.0` has been used. For different versions you might need to build your own kicbase image.\\n\\nOne crucial note: cri-o is running in root mode, this is why we mount to `/var/lib/containers` (and then in rootful mode).\\n\\nFor simplicity, let\'s use a rootful podman machine to map the same folder at the two locations.\\n\\nOk now let\'s try in two steps:\\n\\n1. Create a podman machine:\\n\\n```shell\\npodman machine init --cpus 4 --memory 6000 --rootful\\n```\\n\\n2. Start the cluster using our kicbase image\\n\\nWe specify Podman as the driver (the default is Docker), state our preference to use cri-o as the container runtime instead of containerd, use our custom image that performs the update of Podman\'s version and the modification of cri-o\'s configuration to use a different storage folder. Finally, we specify an additional mount.\\n\\n```shell\\nminikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=cri-o --base-image=quay.io/fbenoit/kicbase:multiarch-2023-11-06 --mount --mount-string \\"/var/lib/containers:/host-containers\\"\\n```\\n\\n#### Verification\\n\\nAssuming the cluster was able to start, there is a new kubernetes cluster configured in the `$HOME/.kube/config` file.\\n\\nUsing `kubectl` we can start a deployment\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml\\n```\\n\\nyou can check pods are running using\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl get pods -l app=nginx\\n```\\n\\nand if you check your podman images\\n\\n```\\npodman images\\n```\\n\\nyou\'ll see nginx being listed so images are shared.\\n\\nNow, you can build image using a Containerfile or pull an image, connect to the control plane instance in Podman Desktop (open a shell in minikube container) and run\\n\\n```shell\\ncrictl images\\n```\\n\\nIt will list the images of podman\\n\\nNote: by default, kubernetes will use the image pull policy `Always` using the `latest` tag on your image. So it might try to fetch/pull/refresh the image you built locally. Use a specific tag or change the `imagePullPolicy` to `IfNotPresent` in your deployments.\\n\\nYou can now use your own Containerfile/Dockerfile and build an image using `podman build` command. And then check that the image is available as well in the kubernetes cluster by listing images:\\n\\n```shell\\ncrictl images\\n```\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nWe have explored how developers can significantly reduce turnaround times by integrating Podman and Kubernetes seamlessly.\\n\\nNow, let\'s experiment with it and provide feedback through the Podman Desktop issue tracker at https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/ .\\n\\nHere are the next steps Podman Desktop plans to take to enhance ease of use for users:\\n\\n- To make things easier, automate the process by adding this setup to a creation wizard.\\n- Collaborate with upstream Minikube project to simplify choices and remove the requirement for customized kicbase images.\\n- Enhancing the overall user-friendliness of the solution for an improved developer experience."},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-1.5","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.5","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-03-release-1.5.md","title":"Podman Desktop 1.5 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.5 has been released!","date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 3, 2023","tags":[{"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"},{"label":"openshift","permalink":"/blog/tags/openshift"},{"label":"onboarding","permalink":"/blog/tags/onboarding"},{"label":"compose","permalink":"/blog/tags/compose"},{"label":"extensions","permalink":"/blog/tags/extensions"},{"label":"settings","permalink":"/blog/tags/settings"}],"readingTime":8.14,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"M\xe1ir\xedn Duffy","title":"User Experience Designer","url":"https://github.com/mairin","imageURL":"https://github.com/mairin.png","key":"duffy"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.5 Release","description":"Podman Desktop 1.5 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-1.5","authors":"duffy","tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes","openshift","onboarding","compose","extensions","settings"],"hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.5/onboarding-selkies.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Share your local podman images with the Kubernetes cluster","permalink":"/blog/sharing-podman-images-with-kubernetes-cluster"},"nextItem":{"title":"Podman Desktop 1.4 Release","permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.4"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nPodman Desktop 1.5 Release! \ud83c\udf89\\n\\nWith this release of Podman Desktop, we\'re introducing **a new onboarding feature** that we hope will earn your \ud83e\uddad seal of approval!

[#4172](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4172)\\n\\n- \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop extensions now have a consistent way to run administrative tasks. [#4049](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4049)\\n\\n- Extensions now have the ability to register a custom Kubernetes config generator. [#3970](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3970)\\n\\n- The ability of extensions to add commands to UI menus has been extended; previously for action menus it was only available in the Image list screen. It is now possible for extensions to add commands to the action menus of items listed on the Containers list screen as well. [#3947](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3947) &amp; [#3963](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3963)\\n\\n- Extensions have gained the ability to contribute menu items in the UI based on specific conditions. [#3959](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3959)\\n\\n- Enhanced logic for displaying or hiding properties listed under the **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" />Settings > Preferences** screens is now available. [#4159](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4159)\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/271650937-3991565c-12a4-4e6c-a315-9343bfa25f65.mov\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- The progress of loading an image into Kind is now visible as a task in the task manager. [#4061](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4061)\\n\\n![kind-progress-task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42176370/270154775-eb7007b4-fd0e-4287-be9e-40ffc412de35.png)\\n\\n- It\'s now possible to start a new Podman machine right after creation, or you can create it and wait to start it later. It\'s up to you! [#4046](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4046)\\n\\n![podman-start-now-or-later](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/269941187-f4768833-ecfc-4d0b-8acf-d4afedb428d9.png)\\n\\n- The Podman machine and Kubernetes provider creation forms have an updated look & feel consisted with other forms in the user interface, along with minor bug fixes. [#4317](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4317)\\n\\n![Updated provider creation forms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/274694157-fe89f3bc-e5b8-4735-96e9-669fe52c7a41.png)\\n\\n- The empty screen message shown when a search filter results in no matches now provides a message specific to filter matching, including the specific filter terms and an explicit button for clearing the filter. Previously, the screen displayed a generic message about how to create new objects of the type displayed on the screen, which led to some confusion about the status of the system. [#3988](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3988)\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/269291090-13e724f7-252f-4915-bb04-00665001d21d.mov\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n- New support for adding spin animations to icons is now available. [#4188](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4188)\\n\\n- There is a new indeterminate progress bar type available for the task manager; this is meant for providing limited status for actions whose APIs do not provide detailed status information. [#4016](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4016)\\n\\n- For authenticating as admin to perform administrative tasks, \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop now provides touchID support for macOS. [#4050](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4050)\\n\\n![touchID-support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/248588015-f08115bd-d211-43ad-bddd-286d7b3a7056.png)\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/269859758-47581e2b-8469-4e9c-822c-f4fddf46684d.mp4\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n- Support for connecting to interactive terminals for containers via tty was added. [#3900](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3900)\\n\\n- It\'s now more clear which container/pod providers will autostart when \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop starts. Previously autostart had both a global and a per-provider setting. It has been simplified by removing the global setting. [#3840](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3840)\\n\\n- The \\"Working with containers\\" section of the documentation has been reworked and improved. [#3951](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3951)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n- The disable registry command was not blocking subsequent pulls from disabled registries. This has been corrected. [#4183](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4183)\\n\\n- Some users behind network proxies were unable to complete workflow involving the download of online resources. The mechanism for fetching these resources has been fixed to be proxy compatible to address this issue. [#3994](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3994)\\n\\n- The status of pods running in Kubernetes that are undergoing the deletion process is now accurately reflected in the \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop UI. [#3877](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3877)\\n\\n- The image details page always listed the image as being \\"not used\\" even when it was. This has been corrected. [#3985](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3985)\\n\\n- Previously, deleting a specific image tag would cause all tags with the same Image ID to be deleted. This has been fixed so only the selected image tag will be deleted. [#3837](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3837)\\n\\n- Could not view the pod details for some remote Kubernetes cluster pods due to an encoding error. [#4371](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4371)\\n\\n- Error logs were being tracked separately from the actions they applied to. This has been addressed for kind cluster creation failure [#4427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4427) and Compose installation failure [#4407](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4407).\\n\\n- For Linux users, \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop previously did not appear under the \\"Development\\" menu when installed via Flatpak; it appeared under \\"Utilities.\\" \ud83e\uddad Podman Desktop now appears under the \\"Development\\" menu. [#3911](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3911)\\n\\n- Podman Machine names are no longer prefixed with the \\"Podman Machine\\" string. [#3878](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3878)\\n\\n![touchID-support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/267378447-aafdfbd7-f005-4b94-8626-9e11eec61b95.png)\\n\\n- The initial action state of pods and containers was being displayed as \\"STARTING\\" regardless of actual state; this has been corrected. [#3889](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3889)\\n\\n- Resizing the application window no longer makes the last lines of a container\'s terminal invisible. [#3993](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3993)\\n\\n- An issue with incorrect terminal behavior in response to long lines in the terminal attached to a container has been resolved. [#3955](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3955)\\n\\n- A spacing issue on the run image form has been corrected. [#4089]https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4089\\n\\n- The \\"podify\\" icon & button on the Containers list was unusually large in release 1.4. That regression has been corrected in this release. [#4122](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4122)\\n\\n- An error in the instructions for Windows users on migrating from Docker has been corrected.

However, it\\nhas not been easy to discover new extensions.\\n\\nWith 1.0 we show a list of featured extensions in the **Welcome**\\n[#2354](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2354), the **Dashboard** and in\\n**<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Extensions**\\n[#2355](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2355). Check out the new\\nextensions for **Red Hat OpenShift Local** and the **Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift**!\\n\\n![Featured extensions](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/featured-extensions.png)\\n\\n### Featured Extensions\\n\\nSpeaking of extensions, let\'s take a minute to turn the spotlight on these two!\\n\\nHave another idea for extending Podman Desktop? We would love to hear from you or see\\nwhat you can create with the [Extension documentation](/docs/extensions),\\nand feature your extension here.\\n\\n#### Red Hat OpenShift Local\\n\\nOpenShift Local is a fully-featured single-node OpenShift cluster designed to run on your local computer.\\nWith this extension you can install, start/stop, and deploy pods or YAML to OpenShift Local,\\nallowing you to test your applications on a full OpenShift environment, ensuring a consistent\\nexperience between development, test, and production.\\n\\nThe recent addition of the MicroShift preset provides a lighter, optimized option that\\nstarts faster and uses less resources for deployments that still want OpenShift compatibility\\nwithout the full set of OpenShift services.\\n\\n![OpenShift Local](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/openshift-local.png)\\n\\n#### Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift\\n\\nThe OpenShift Developer Sandbox is a free, cloud-based OpenShift environment that allows developers to\\ncreate, build, and deploy applications to OpenShift for 30 days. With this extension you can sign up\\nand easily deploy pods or YAML to a hosted OpenShift environment without a local installation or\\nleaving Podman Desktop.\\n\\n![Developer Sandbox](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/sandbox.png)\\n\\n### Podman Machine as Root\\n\\nWhen creating a Podman machine you can now decide to run as root [#2427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2427). This is a prerequisite for some scenarios, such as running Kind on Windows.\\n\\n![Podman machine as root](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/podman-root.png)\\n\\n### Other UI and UX Improvements\\n\\n#### Prompt to Open External Website\\n\\nIn the previous release links to external websites were blocked due to the security risk.\\nIn 1.0 you can click to see the URL and have the option of opening or copying it\\n[#2414](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2414).\\n\\n![External link dialog](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/external-link.png)\\n\\n#### Editable Numeric Preferences\\n\\nTired of clicking +, +, +? Us too. Numeric preferences are now editable so\\nyou can directly enter the value you want\\n[#2368](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2368).\\n\\n![Editing numbers](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/edit-number.png)\\n\\n#### Navigation tooltips\\n\\nWe like our new navigation bar, but the tooltips were slow to appear.

Well yes, last time we did add support for installing\\nthe Contour ingress controller on Kind [#1675](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1675),\\nbut you still couldn\'t access your containers without the corresponding ingress.\\n\\nThis release adds a simple checkbox you can use when deploying to Kind to create an ingress and\\nmake your service accessible [#1322](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1322).\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/232894496-cbaea036-a14c-46c6-bfa3-bacca629a161.mov\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### Podliness: Ability to Choose External Ports when Podifying Containers\\n\\nWhen you create a pod from of a set of containers (Podifying!), you probably don\'t want to expose every\\nsingle port from every container to the world. With an updated panel you can now see which ports each container\\nexposes, pick which should remain visible outside the pod, and which are for internal use\\n[#2232](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2232).\\n\\n![Podify page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/234527674-ed14f52c-8f66-445f-8038-c8135bb61136.gif)\\n\\n### Cleanliness: New Navigation Bar, Dialogs, and Palette\\n\\nIt was time to catch up on some design ideas and do some UI cleanup!\\n\\n#### New Navgation Bar\\n\\nThe navigation bar is now always fixed on the left size, without labels. This opens up more space\\nfor the content on each page, and is easier to jump in and out of **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings**.\\n[#2167](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2167)\\n\\n![Navigation bar](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/navigation.png)\\n\\n#### Updated Dialogs\\n\\nWe wanted messages and dialog boxes to feel a bit more integrated, so we have a new message box\\n[#1808](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1808) and use it for all dialogs opened by\\nextensions, pruning containers/pods/images/volumes [#2138](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2138),\\nand updating Podman Desktop itself [#2249](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2249).\\n\\n![Dialog](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/dialog.png)\\n\\n#### Colors\\n\\nWe spent some time tweaking colors and closing on our final palette\\n[#2199](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2199), updating the colors in the terminal & detail page\\n[#2222](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2222), tweaking the navigation and main page colors\\n[#2223](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2223),\\nand improving the look of forms [#2156](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2156).\\n\\nWe\'re not done yet, but hopefully you will notice a more polished, consistent, good-looking application!\\n\\n### Other UI and UX Improvements\\n\\n#### Markdown Support for Extensions\\n\\nWe added a new component to display markdown [#2219](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2219) and\\nenabled it in preferences [#2253](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2253), and\\nprovider properties/creation pages [#2152](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2152).\\nWe can now embed links and other formatting in preferences, and extensions can use them in many places, for example:\\n\\n![Markdown](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/markdown.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- We know which **Settings** page is used the most often, so now it\'s the default: **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Resources** [#2105](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2105).\\n\\n- Extensions can now use the Tasks API to let long running tasks continue in the background [#2019](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2019) and the existing withProgress API also uses the task manager now\\n  [#2187](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2187).\\n\\n![Task API](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/695993/233560830-85cfa685-5dcd-4efa-9fae-730a8a9eef3b.gif)\\n\\n- Images are now sorted by age [#2311](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2311).\\n\\n- When you start/stop a container or pod, the button is now animated instead of having an separate spinner\\n  [#2101](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2101).\\n\\n- The **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences** page now has a search bar [#2128](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2128).\\n\\n![Search preferences](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/prefs.png)\\n\\n- The Help page has been updated [#431](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/431).\\n\\n![Updated Help](img/podman-desktop-release-0.15/help.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable Bug Fixes\\n\\n- There was no way to see log or outcome if you leave the Kind cluster creation page [#2079](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2079).\\n- Kind image load doesn\'t show a notification [#2225](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2225).\\n- Fix odd selection in **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Extensions** [#2130](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2130).\\n- Menus are now cleaned up properly when extensions are stopped [#2188](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2188).\\n- Kind clusters are now cleaned up when Podman machine is stopped [#2306](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2306).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Final notes\\n\\nThe complete list of issues fixed in this release is available [here](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.15.0).\\n\\nGet the latest release from the [Downloads](/downloads) section of the website and boost your development journey with Podman Desktop.

More importantly,\\nproviding tools that allow you to manage both environments and seamlessly move between them.\\n\\nSome of these features were available in development mode over the last few releases,\\nbut since they are now in the release build, we will do a full roundup and talk about\\nall the Kind features.\\n\\n\x3c!--Main Features--\x3e\\n\\n- **Kind Installation**: Install Kind from the status bar\\n- **Manage Kind Clusters**: Create and manage Kind clusters from **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Resources**\\n- **Using Kind**: Deploying YAML and sharing images to a cluster\\n- **Kind Ingress**: Install a Contour ingress controller\\n- **UX and UI Improvements**: Updated preferences and telemetry prompt\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.14 is now available.

The Kind extension is now bundled as part of Podman Desktop\\n[1421](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1421)\\nand allows you to easily [install Kind directly from the status bar](/docs/kind/installing)\\n[1257](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1257).\\n\\nThe installed `kind` CLI is available from the system shell [1516](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1516),\\nallowing you to open a terminal window to `kind get clusters` or work with other tools.\\n\\n### Manage Kind Clusters\\n\\nOnce Kind is installed (or if you already had it), you can manage your clusters in **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Resources**.\\nFrom here you can [create Kind clusters](/docs/kind/creating-a-kind-cluster),\\nstart/stop [1953](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1953)\\nor delete [1977](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1977) them.\\n\\n![kind-clusters](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/kind-clusters.png)\\n\\nThe Kind control plane runs as a container. You will see this container\\nin the **Container** list and can also start or stop it from there.\\n\\n### Using Kind\\n\\nNow that you have Kind installed and running, what can you do with it?\\nIf you like terminals, you can always open one up and use the Kind CLI to\\n[interact with your cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#interacting-with-your-cluster).\\n\\nWithin Podman Desktop we have started with two ways to interact with the cluster.\\nThe first is the ability to play local YAML files on your Kind (or any other Kubernetes!) cluster [1261](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1261). This allows you to take existing Kubernetes YAML definitions -\\nyour deployments, services, or other objects - and deploy it to the cluster.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/231812563-ece0a56a-b347-48f8-a3a7-400eb9449037.mp4\\" width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\nAs you deploy pods, they will automatically appear in the list of **Pods** [1263](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1263), allowing you to start, stop, and interact them just like pods running on Podman.\\n\\nOne of the most common uses is to deploy a container that you have been running on Podman, and this will fail\\nif the image is not available in Kind. To solve this we have made it easy to push images from\\nPodman to Kind [1448](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1448).\\n\\n![push-image-kind](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/push-image-kind.png)\\n\\n### Kind Ingress\\n\\nIf you deploy a pod to Kind, you are also going to want to reach it! To do this you will need to install a load balancer or\\ningress controller so that the pod is accessible from outside the cluster. We made it easy to install the Contour ingress\\ncontroller while creating a Kind cluster [1675](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1675),\\nso if you created your cluster with Podman Desktop it is already there!\\n\\n![kind-ingress](img/podman-desktop-release-0.14/kind-ingress.png)\\n\\nWe have several other Kind and Kubernetes features planned to expand the supported scenarios, but hopefully this\\nmakes it easy to get started with Kind and shows where we\'re headed. As always, feedback is appreciated!\\n\\n### UI and UX improvements\\n\\n#### Updated Preferences\\n\\nThe **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences** page has been updated with a new design [1913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1913),\\nmaking it easier to see and change preferences.

But the UI depends on Docker API and it is not possible to use the UI with Docker and Podman at the same time.\\n\\nPodman Desktop is a multi-engine UI tool. The UI is compatible with the API of Docker and Podman. It means all containers and images from all the engines at the same time are visible in the UI.\\n\\nWhen migrating from Docker to Podman, you can use Podman Desktop to interact with containers running in Docker. Explore all commands and features of Podman Desktop and see all the resources from Docker.\\n\\n![Many container engines at the same time](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/multiple-container-engines.png)\\n\\n## Docker compatibility mode\\n\\nUsing Podman with Podman Desktop or with the Podman CLI is straightforward. But some tools expect to find `docker` CLI or `docker.sock` socket. In this case, you have to use the compatibility mode of Podman.\\n\\n### Socket file compatibility\\n\\nThe socket compatibility mode is a feature of Podman that allows to bind the Podman socket under the Docker socket path.\\n\\nOn Windows the socket compatibility mode is always enabled by default. On macOS, by using the `.pkg installer` it is active by default. But when installing with `brew`, it will not be there because it requires some admin permissions.\\n\\nThat is not an issue because you can enable it by [invoking a CLI tool](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/using-podman-mac-helper) that will setup the compatibility mode.\\n\\nFor example if you use [`TestContainers`](https://www.testcontainers.org/) in your Java project, you can use the compatibility mode to ensure that the tool will use Podman instead of Docker.\\n\\n### CLI compatibility\\n\\nIf you have scripts relying on `docker` CLI, you can use the compatibility mode to ensure that the tool is working with Podman instead of Docker.\\n\\nIf you have the `docker` CLI installed on your computer, you can use the socket file compatibility of docker to ensure that the tool is working with Podman engine instead of Docker.\\n\\nIf you do not have the `docker` CLI installed on your computer, you can [Create a script](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/emulating-docker-cli-with-podman) called `docker` that will call the `podman` CLI\\n\\n**_NOTE:_** creating a shell prompt alias, for example `alias docker=podman`, will not work inside scripts that you call.\\n\\n## Compose\\n\\nAs a user of Docker, you might use `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`) to run some of your applications.\\n\\nFor now Podman does not include a `Compose` support directly in the CLI with a command `podman compose`.\\n\\n`Compose` can work with the Podman socket.\\n\\nBased on the compatibility mode (see [section about Docker compatibility mode](#docker-compatibility-mode)):\\n\\n- Enabled: you can use the `compose` binary to run your applications.\\n- Disabled: you need to [export the environment variable DOCKER_HOST](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/using-the-docker_host-environment-variable) before running compose.\\n\\nYou can now use the `compose` binary to run your applications and it will use Podman engine.\\n\\nPodman Desktop has a `compose` extension that can fetch `compose` binary if not already available on the filesystem.\\n\\nPodman Desktop UI displays the containers created by `Compose` are in the same group.\\n\\n![Compose support in the UI](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/compose-containers-in-ui.png)\\n\\n## Kubernetes\\n\\nIt is possible to start a Kubernetes cluster with Docker.\\n\\nPodman supports directly a subset of Kubernetes resources that you can use with `.yaml` files.\\n\\nFor example if you only want to create a `Pod` resource, you can use the `Play Kubernetes YAML` button from the `Containers` list screen with your `.yaml` file. No need to install or start a Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n![Play Kubernetes YAML](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/play-kubernetes-yaml.png)\\n\\nIt is possible to do the counter-part. Export the definition of a container or pod to a Kubernetes resource. You can use the `Generate kube` button from the kebab menu of a given container or pod.\\n\\n![Kubernetes generate](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/kube-generate.png)\\n\\nPodman handles pods and in the Podman Desktop UI, you can see all the pods inside a Pod section. All containers inside the pod are in the same group.\\n\\n![Pods in the UI](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/pods-in-ui.png)\\n\\n![Containers from pod](img/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user/containers-from-pod.png)\\n\\nAn experimental `kind` extension is bringing the creation of full-blown Kubernetes cluster with Podman.\\n\\n## Rootless mode\\n\\nOne of the difference of Docker and Podman is the way they handle containers. Docker requires root privileges to run containers by default. Podman can run containers without root privileges by default.\\n\\nIt means that for example, starting a container with a port < 1024 will not work. You need to use a port > 1024.\\n\\nIf you still need to create containers with a port < 1024, you can change the Podman machine configuration of the Podman Machine if you are on Windows or macOS.\\n\\nThe command is `podman machine set --rootful` to enable the execution with root privileges or `podman machine set --rootful=false` to switch back to rootless mode."},{"id":"podman-desktop-release-0.12","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.12","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-15-release-0.12.md","title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.12","description":"Podman Desktop 0.12 has been released!","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"podman-desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/podman-desktop"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":4.505,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Stevan Le Meur","title":"Product Manager","url":"https://github.com/slemeur","imageURL":"https://github.com/slemeur.png","key":"slemeur"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.12","description":"Podman Desktop 0.12 has been released!","slug":"podman-desktop-release-0.12","authors":["slemeur"],"tags":["podman-desktop","release","kubernetes"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"5 things to know about Podman Desktop for a Docker user","permalink":"/blog/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release Notes - Podman Desktop 0.11","permalink":"/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.11"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nThis release note covers Podman Desktop 0.12 release changes.\\n\\n\x3c!--Main Features--\x3e\\n\\n- **Podman Version**: Podman 4.4.1 now included in Windows and Mac installers.\\n- **Containers Configuration**: Configure port mappings for an image without exported ports.\\n- **Windows Home Support**: Podman Desktop now supports Windows Home Edition.\\n- **Start minimized**: Option to start Podman Desktop minimized to system tray.\\n- **UX and UI Improvements**: Consistent actions, placeholder for logs, unified icons and others.\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.12 is now available.

It relies on the Docker socket helper provided with Podman and automatically handle the local setup of Podman path to the Docker socket. Tools like [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) or others are relying on this to communicate to the container engine.\\n\\nIn this new version of Podman Desktop, we are now providing information to the user about the status of this compatibility mode directly on the dashboard page. The way it works is the following:\\n\\n- When Docker is running: the socket is pointing to Docker.\\n- When Podman is starting and Docker is not running: the docker API socket will use Podman.\\n\\nIn case the compatibility mode is not activated, new documentation on how to activate it and how to easily switch between Docker and Podman is available here: [https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker).\\n\\nThis is a warning displayed for Windows users:\\n![windows-docker-compatibility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/209305744-9056addd-f122-4f75-9e03-ad27a0109375.png)\\n\\nThis is the warning for Mac users:\\n![mac-docker-compatibility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/207964861-a9c1f72c-89d6-4816-beab-397af4125620.png)\\n\\n### Allow to toggle on/off the proxy setting [#983](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/983)\\n\\nIn some context, users need the ability to disable and re-enable the proxy configuration very quickly, without having to entirely reconfigure it. This is now possible from the Podman Desktop settings page, where a toggle to enable/disable the proxy configuration has been added.\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/205955418-670bc37c-a74f-40ef-bc60-8d9d013aa0dc.mp4\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\nNote: extensions can read this information and then update the proxy configuration.\\n\\n### Namespace selection for deploy to Kubernetes [#1008](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1008)\\n\\nA new dropdown menu has been added to the deploy to Kubernetes screen to allow selecting the namespace to deploy to. Defaults to defaultnamespace, if unable to get any from kube_client module.\\n\\nIf the user have set `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=NAMESPACE` it honors that as the chosen value.\\n\\n![deploy-kubernetes-namespace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7339809/206688886-095e4f15-42ae-4a0a-b1c6-ae4b547fcdfb.gif)\\n\\n### Configure Podman binary path [#941](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/941)\\n\\nUsers might use a custom path to the podman binary. An option within settings (Settings -> Preferences) to allow providing an additional path to Podman binary has been added.\\nThis is useful for users who have installed Podman using a package manager and want to use the binary provided by the package manager.\\nSee: [Unable to set custom binary path for Podman on macOS](/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-podman-on-macos#unable-to-set-custom-binary-path-for-podman-on-macos)\\n![custom-path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/204832063-5858065a-2fc3-49de-8d23-3b99b7d10dbf.png)\\n\\n### Provide pre-defined registries [#1201](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1201)\\n\\nThe experience of configuring a registry is getting simplified for the most popular ones. The user will be able to select a registry from a pre-defined list and will only have to provide the username and password. The following registries will be pre-defined:\\n\\n- Dockerhub\\n- Red Hat Quay\\n- GitHub\\n- IBM Container Registry\\n- Google Container Registry\\n\\n<ReactPlayer playing controls url=\'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/214332937-eb1d9050-0d32-4bc4-8393-49b4583b1390.mov\' width=\'100%\' height=\'100%\' />\\n\\n### UI/UX Improvements\\n\\n#### View Pods logs [#1122](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1122)\\n\\nThe pods details view provides the ability to view the logs of each containers that might be running in a pod. Moreover, as it can also be hard to scan and identify which container is producing which output, we appended the container name at the beginning of each output and differentiate each container with a different color.\\n\\n![pods-logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/211024673-eee9bad8-1b0c-4446-b8d1-97a226282c4d.png)\\n\\n#### Improved feedback when clicking on container list action icons [#1150](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1150) [#1161](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1161)\\n\\nWhen starting/stopping or deleting a container, a spinner is now displayed.

[Click here to download it](/downloads)!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Details\\n\\n### New configuration wizzard to create containers ([#773](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/773))\\n\\nUntil now, we could only specify port binding when building images to start containers. The create container wizzard now includes several options enabling configuring volumes, environment variables, restart policy and settings on networking and security. It is also possible to reuse an existing (and already configured) a network when creating containers.\\n\\n![new container creation wizard](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/new_container_creation_wizard.gif)\\n\\n### Kubernetes Capabilities Improvements\\n\\n**Custom Kubeconfig file path ([#780](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/780))**\\n\\nKubeconfig path location is now configurable from **<Icon icon=\\"fa-solid fa-cog\\" size=\\"lg\\" /> Settings > Preferences > Kubernetes: Kubeconfig** and can be set to a custom path. By default, Podman Desktop use the path `$HOME/.kube/config` for the Kubeconfig file.\\n\\n![custom kubeconfig file path](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/custom-kubeconfig.png)\\n\\n**Play Kubernetes YAML from the Pods list ([#739](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/739))**\\n\\nPodman Desktop enables to play existing Kubernetes YAML files. This is now available from `Play Kubernetes YAML` button added to the Pods list, in addition to the Containers list.\\n\\n![play k8s yaml](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/play_k8s_yaml.gif)\\n\\n**Kube context automatically reloaded when updated ([#813](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/813))**\\n\\nAny change to the kube context will now be detected by Podman Desktop in its running state. The system tray, allowing to select which Kubernetes environment to work with, will now reload the kube context without restarting Podman Desktop.\\n\\n### Revamped Container Registries UI ([#446](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/446))\\n\\nThe registries configuration UI has been revamped. Instead of using tiles for displaying the registries, now it uses a list where each registry can be added or edited directly in the list. The kebab menu provides options to edit or remove a registry from the list.\\n\\n![registries](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/registries.png)\\n\\n### Update to Podman 4.3.1 ([#913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/913))\\n\\nPodman Desktop 0.10 is now embedding [Podman 4.3.1](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.3.1) in Windows and macOS installers.\\n\\n### UI/UX Improvements\\n\\n**Improved lists UX ([#877](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/877))**\\n\\nTo reduce the width used in the lists when displaying all the icons, main actions icons are now always displayed (before it was on hover) and the secondary actions are displayed in a kebab menu. For example Start/Stop and delete are primary actions while open the browser, inspect, generate kube yaml, etc. are secondary options.\\n\\n![kebab menu](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/kebab-menu.png)\\n\\n**Delay appearance of text in navbar ([#767](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/767))**\\n\\nWhen minimizing or expanding the navbar, the text was overlapping for a few second the page. Now it\'s displayed with a fading animation.\\n\\n**Selected state: better text color contrast ([#802](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/802))**\\n\\nIn the `Images` page, on hover for both the image and the name column, the text contrast has been increased for better visibility: violet indicates that you have selected it.\\n\\n![text color when hover](img/podman-desktop-release-0.10/text-color.gif)\\n\\n**On Linux and Windows, the menu bar is now hidden by default ([#668](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/668))**\\n\\nWith this change, the menu bar looks more integrated to the Operating System. The menu can appear if you hit the `Alt` key. Thanks to [Dylan M. Taylor](https://github.com/dylanmtaylor) for contributing to fix this.\\n\\n**Exit when clicking on the close icon of the dashboard on Linux ([#671](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/671))**\\n\\nFor most users on Linux, there is no tray icon support. In this situation, when closed, Podman Desktop continues to run in background. [Dylan M. Taylor](https://github.com/dylanmtaylor) added a property to exit the app by default when clicking on the close icon. For people having tray icon support or with the desire of a different behavior, it is possible to disable it from the Settings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Other Notable Enhancements\\n\\n- Rename `Started` into `Age` in Containers list.([#878](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/878))\\n- Added domain validation when adding a registry. ([#838](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/838))\\n- Provided a consistent behavior with Podman CLI, `podman-machine-default` is now the default name when creating a Podman machine from Podman Desktop. ([#775](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/775))\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notable bug fixes\\n\\n- Fixed error handling when pulling images of Desktop Extensions. ([#782](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/782))\\n- Fixed use of the full height of the screen when displaying log in the details of a container. ([#946](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions/946))\\n- Fixed First start of Podman Desktop on flatpak was not seeing the podman engine ([#860](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/860))\\n\\n## Community Thank You\\n\\n\ud83c\udf89 We\u2019d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make Podman Desktop 0.10 even better:\\n\\n- [Dylan M.

The Development Container works locally using Visual Studio Code but in this blog post we will see how it works directly with a simple click from GitHub.\\n\\nThe challenges are to run a desktop tool (Podman Desktop) and running a container engine (Podman) inside this Development Container without using too many memory !\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Defining image of the container\\n\\nThe first thing is in the choice of the image for the container. It is possible to pick-up a default image and add some features but there is no existing feature for Podman at https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src and most of the features are expecting to run on top of Debian/Ubuntu\\n\\nIf you are not interested in how to setup the image, jump to the [next section](#configure-the-devcontainer-using-devcontainerjson).\\n\\nPodman binaries are available quickly after the releases for Fedora. I decided then to use `Fedora 37` as the base image.\\n\\nLet start the Containerfile using:\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM quay.io/fedora/fedora:37\\n```\\n\\nThen I install Node.js 16 from official nodejs.org repository. It\'s easier to switch to the version that we need.\\n\\n```docker\\n# install Node.js + yarn\\nENV NODE_VERSION 16.18.1\\nRUN curl -SLO \\"https://nodejs.org/dist/v$NODE_VERSION/node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" && \\\\\\n    tar -xzf \\"node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" -C /usr/local --strip-components=1 && \\\\\\n    rm \\"node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\\" && \\\\\\n    npm install -g yarn\\n```\\n\\nNow, all system dependencies used to run an Electron application needs to be installed.\\n\\nPodman is also installed so we can run some containers inside this container.\\n\\nAnd of course, we need to install VNC (I choose [tigervnc](https://tigervnc.org/)) with a light Window Manager ([fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)).\\n\\nTo connect to the display of the container, we need to expose VNC over HTML/websocket using [noVNC](https://novnc.com/)\\n\\nxterm is installed to start a terminal from the VNC side.\\n\\n```docker\\nRUN dnf -y update && \\\\\\n    yum -y reinstall shadow-utils && \\\\\\n    yum install -y git \\\\\\n                   # dependencies for Podman Desktop\\n                   nss \\\\\\n                   atk \\\\\\n                   at-spi2-atk \\\\\\n                   cups-libs \\\\\\n                   gtk3 \\\\\\n                   # for remote Display\\n                   fluxbox \\\\\\n                   tigervnc-server \\\\\\n                   xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 \\\\\\n                   novnc \\\\\\n                   supervisor \\\\\\n                   xdpyinfo \\\\\\n                   # for podman\\n                   podman \\\\\\n                   fuse-overlayfs --exclude container-selinux \\\\\\n                   xterm && \\\\\\n    rm -rf /var/cache /var/log/dnf* /var/log/yum.*\\n```\\n\\nSupervisord setup the launch of the VNC server and the Window manager\\n\\n```docker\\nCOPY supervisord.conf /etc/supervisord.conf\\n```\\n\\nA custom theme for fluxbox:\\n\\n```docker\\nCOPY fluxbox /usr/share/fluxbox/init\\n```\\n\\nThen we need a special configuration to allow to have Podman working inside the container\\n\\nWe add the `podman-desktop` user with correct range on subuid and subgid when running containers. I used the [tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#etcsubuid-and-etcsubgid-configuration).\\n\\n```docker\\nRUN useradd -u 1000 podman-desktop && echo podman-desktop:10000:5000 > /etc/subuid && echo podman-desktop:10000:5000 > /etc/subgid\\n```\\n\\nThen use some default configuration files\\n\\n```docker\\n# initialize conf files\\nADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/libpod/master/contrib/podmanimage/stable/containers.conf /etc/containers/containers.conf\\nADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/libpod/master/contrib/podmanimage/stable/podman-containers.conf /home/podman-desktop/.config/containers/containers.conf\\n```\\n\\nand make sure that all permissions are correct following the guide [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container)\\n\\n```docker\\n# set permissions\\nRUN chown podman-desktop:podman-desktop -R /home/podman-desktop && chmod 644 /etc/containers/containers.conf && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p /var/lib/shared/overlay-images /var/lib/shared/overlay-layers /var/lib/shared/vfs-images /var/lib/shared/vfs-layers; touch /var/lib/shared/overlay-images/images.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/overlay-layers/layers.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/vfs-images/images.lock; touch /var/lib/shared/vfs-layers/layers.lock && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p /run/user/1000 && chown podman-desktop:podman-desktop /run/user/1000\\n```\\n\\nplus define an empty user namespace.\\n\\n```docker\\nENV _CONTAINERS_USERNS_CONFIGURED=\\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nMake sure Podman will create the socket in an expected directory:\\n\\n```docker\\n# socket path for podman\\nENV XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000\\n```\\n\\nOK ! we have a custom Containerfile providing all the tools to build and run Podman Desktop (using VNC for the display), run Podman and run Electron.\\n\\nThe current file is available at https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/blob/main/.devcontainer/.parent/Containerfile\\n\\nLet\'s configure the DevContainer.\\n\\n## Configure the DevContainer using devcontainer.json\\n\\nDevContainer definition is stored at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.\\n\\nWe need to reuse the image of the previous step. For that let\'s use the build section of the `devcontainer.json` file.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"build\\": {\\n  \\"dockerfile\\": \\"Containerfile\\"\\n},\\n```\\n\\nIn order to avoid to redo all the build steps each time we open a workspace using this dev container, we published the image to quay.io at [quay.io/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent:next\\n](https://quay.io/repository/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent?tab=tags&tag=next). This parent image is not changing much so it\'s better to use is as a parent one.\\n\\nInside `.devcontainer` directory there is a `.parent` directory with everything related to the parent image.\\n\\nAnd in the `.devcontainer/Containerfile` file we reference this image\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM quay.io/podman-desktop/devcontainer-parent:next\\n```\\n\\nBy default, we will be `root` in the container and this is probably not what we expect. Let\'s change that.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"containerUser\\": \\"podman-desktop\\"\\n```\\n\\nSome Visual Studio Code extensions are nice to use and we can add them\\n\\n```json\\n  \\"extensions\\": [\\"svelte.svelte-vscode\\", \\"bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThen here is the tricky part, how to run our container allowing to run again inside the container some containers with podman.\\n\\nWe specify the arguments to make it possible. It\'s possible to use `--privileged` flag but I prefer to list the subset of permissions.\\nUsing `--privileged` we don\'t really know what are the privilege that are required while specifying all of them, people are aware of what is granted/denied.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"runArgs\\": [\\n    \\"--cap-add=sys_admin\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"seccomp=unconfined\\",\\n    \\"--device\\",\\n    \\"/dev/fuse\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"label=disable\\",\\n    \\"--security-opt\\",\\n    \\"apparmor=unconfined\\"\\n  ],\\n```\\n\\nSource code of Podman Desktop needs to be editable within the DevContainer so it needs to be mounted.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"workspaceMount\\": \\"source=${localWorkspaceFolder},target=/workspace,type=bind\\",\\n\\"workspaceFolder\\": \\"/workspace\\",\\n```\\n\\nThen we need a command to build Podman Desktop.\\n\\nFor that, we use `onCreateCommand` hook with a custom command\\n\\n```json\\n\\"onCreateCommand\\": \\"${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/onCreateCommand.sh\\",\\n```\\n\\nand in the `.devcontainer` folder the `onCreateCommand.sh` script is the following\\n\\n```shell\\n#!/bin/sh\\nyarn\\n\\nMODE=production yarn run build && yarn run electron-builder build --linux --dir --config .electron-builder.config.cjs\\n```\\n\\nTwo instructions:\\n\\n1. Fetch all Node.js dependencies.\\n2. build Podman Desktop in the `dist` folder using `Linux` as target Operating System.\\n\\nAfter the start of the container, how to launch Podman Desktop, the website and VNC, etc ?\\n\\nJust use `postStartCommand` hook.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"postStartCommand\\": \\"${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.devcontainer/postStartCommand.sh\\",\\n```\\n\\nand in the `.devcontainer` folder the `postStartCommand.sh` script is the following:\\n\\n```shell\\n#!/bin/sh\\n\\n# Start all services\\n/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisord.conf &\\n\\n# wait X server to be ready or after 2mn exit\\necho \\"Waiting for X server to be ready\\"\\ntimeout 120 bash -c \'until xdpyinfo -display :0 &> /dev/null; do printf \\".\\"; sleep 1; done\'\\n\\n# launch podman desktop\\necho \\"Launching Podman Desktop\\"\\ncd dist/linux-unpacked/&& ./podman-desktop &\\n\\n# Launch the 9000 redirect after 20 seconds\\nsleep 20\\nwebsockify --web=/usr/share/novnc localhost:9000 localhost:5900 &\\n\\n# launch the website rendering\\necho \\"Launching Website\\"\\ncd website && yarn start\\n```\\n\\nIt starts VNC and noVNC, start precompiled Podman Desktop and start the documentation rendering.\\n\\nIt is not launching the Watch mode/development mode of Podman Desktop as it requires a container having more than 8GB of memory.\\n\\nPicking up a larger instance with for example 16GB, it\'s possible to use development mode.\\n\\nOf course, to make VNC happy, we need to specify the `DISPLAY` environment variable.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"remoteEnv\\": {\\n  \\"DISPLAY\\": \\":0\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen the DevContainer is fully available, we want to have a way to quickly open the `Website rendering URL` and `noVNC`\\n\\nLet\'s tweak the `devcontainer.json` file by adding the `portsAttributes` section\\n\\n```json\\n\\"portsAttributes\\": {\\n  \\"9000\\": {\\n    \\"label\\": \\"vnc\\",\\n    \\"onAutoForward\\": \\"openPreview\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"3000\\": {\\n    \\"label\\": \\"website\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter all post-creation steps, the `Preview` browser inside the VS Code editor will open a window to VNC. And another port (`3000`) is flagged for the website.\\n\\n## Using the DevContainer.json on Github Codespace\\n\\nAs a user, opening a workspace with all what we configured is done using a single click.\\n\\nGo to https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop then click on the `< > Code` dropdown and click on `Create codespace on main` button.\\n\\n![Open Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-click-repository.png)\\n\\nOnce you click on the button, the codespace is setting up:\\n\\n![Preparing Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-preparing-codespace.png)\\n\\nAfter few minutes, as there is not yet [prebuilt codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds), the codespace is opening.\\n\\nThe simple Browser displays the noVNC window:\\n![Opening Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-open-novnc.png)\\n\\nClick on the connect button. Then on the terminal you can enter `podman run quay.io/podman/hello` and the container is detected in Podman Desktop.\\n![Testing Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-testing-podman-desktop.png)\\n\\nIt\'s also possible using the port widget to get on `3000` port by clicking on the world icon a preview of the website in another tab. Changing source code of the website will refresh the content of the window.\\n\\nDepending on the usecase, it\'s also possible to open documentation in the preview browser.\\n\\n![Edit website Codespace](img/develop-podman-using-codespaces/codespaces-edit-website.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe DevContainer image for Podman Desktop is recent so it\'ll probably evolve over time by adding new capabilities but it allows you to easily build/run/experiment and **contribute** to the tool or the website."}]}')}}]);
